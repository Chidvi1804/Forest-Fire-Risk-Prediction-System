# Forest Fire Risk Prediction System

## Overview
The **Forest Fire Risk Prediction System** project aims to predict the likelihood of forest fires based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and geographical coordinates. This project uses machine learning models to analyze these features and predict whether there is a high risk of fire in a particular region.

The goal is to build a reliable model that can assist in early detection and risk assessment of forest fires, helping to minimize damage and improve safety measures.

## Features
- Predict forest fire risk using machine learning models.
- Analyze environmental data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- Incorporate geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude) for location-based risk prediction.
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models to choose the best one.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chidvi1804/Forest-Fire-Risk-Prediction-System.git
